I’m a 1st year _Management Science_ PhD student at **MIT** in the `IT group at Sloan`. If you don’t know what that means, you’re not alone! My mom still can’t describe it to her friends, so I’ve told her to say “he studies the computational social sciences.” If her friends have more questions, she’s instructed to say “he works at the intersection of computer science, economics, and statistics.” If they keep asking, she runs away and hides.

Before I continue, let me state how wildly narcissistic it is that I, along with most academics, have these self-aggrandizing websites. Now, back to me! My research interests are

-   improving methods for causal inference using statistics and machine learning,
-   studying complexity & social networks. To be honest, I just started my PhD and I know nothing/I’m not sure what I like - check back in a few years for updates.
